# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Banks have commited a lot of time and resources into onboaring their customers, as well as, nurturing their customer's growth. The costs of onboarding new customers is constantly increasing and the bank wants to not only maintain its marketshare but also continue to grow. This means that one of the most important goals is to improve the retention rate of these customers they worked so hard to build a relationship with.

Our goal is to find patterns among customers that churn. Then to provide an early indication for similarly behaving customers. If we can target these customers early we have a greater chance of retaining them as a customer. This can be accomplished by developing loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

We also want to understand the factors that impact churn. By understanding these factors we can generate a churner profile that we can use to evaluate all customers old and new.

> Demonstrate how machine learning models can be strategically applied to attrition (churn). Improve retention rate, provide an early indication of churn, and understand the factors that impact churn (build a churner profile).
